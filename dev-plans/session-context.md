1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The main request was to enhance the existing Elysium USV Data Pipeline to handle files received via FTP instead of direct USV connections. This required implementing MD5 hash validation for incoming files (as opposed to the existing SHA256 validation), developing an efficient file monitoring system, and creating a local testing environment. The intent was to make the pipeline more flexible by supporting multiple data sources while maintaining the same reliability and validation standards.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Worker Pattern: Go implementation of background workers for file processing tasks
   - FTP Integration: Using jlaffaye/ftp Go library for FTP server connectivity with retry logic
   - MD5 Hash Validation: Verifying file integrity using accompanying .md5 hash files
   - Azure Blob Storage: Target storage for validated files
   - Azure Queue Storage: Used for message passing between pipeline stages
   - Docker Containers: Local testing infrastructure with Azurite and Pure-FTPd
   - Directory Watching: Polling mechanism for detecting new files
   - Local File Mode: Special test mode that works with local directories instead of FTP

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/internal/config/config.go`: Enhanced with FTP-specific configuration options including:
     - FTPWatchEnabled, FTPWatchDir, FTPPollInterval
     - FTPHost, FTPPort, FTPUser, FTPPassword
     - FTPRetryCount, FTPRetryDelay
   
   - `/internal/worker/ftp_worker.go`: New worker implementation with key functions:
     - NewFTPWorker(): Creates and initializes the FTP worker
     - connectFTP(): Establishes FTP connection with retries
     - processFTPFiles(): Main function for processing files from FTP
     - processLocalFiles(): Special mode for testing with local files
     - readMD5FromFile(): Parses MD5 hash files
     - calculateMD5(): Computes MD5 hash for validation
   
   - `/tools/docker-compose.yml`: Updated to include:
     - FTP server (stilliard/pure-ftpd)
     - Azurite for Azure Storage emulation
     - FTP data preparation container
   
   - `/tools/prepare-ftp-test-data.sh`: New script for:
     - Creating test data files with vessel IDs
     - Generating MD5 hashes
     - Setting up test environment

4. Problem Solving:
   - FTP Connection Management: Implemented a robust FTP connection with retry logic to handle transient failures
   - Special Testing Mode: Added a "local file mode" (when FTPHost="none") to facilitate testing without requiring an actual FTP server
   - MD5 Hash Validation: Implemented proper parsing and verification of MD5 hash files in various formats
   - File Processing Flow: Created a complete flow from file detection to validation to Azure upload
   - Docker Environment Issues: Fixed syntax errors and configuration issues in Docker Compose
   - Go Type Safety: Resolved go vet errors related to pointer handling in FTP entry types
   - Script Syntax Errors: Fixed issues with shell scripts for test data preparation

5. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete full end-to-end testing with a real FTP server
   - Add unit tests for the FTP worker implementation
   - Investigate and potentially implement fsnotify for more efficient file change detection than polling
   - Create full documentation for the FTP functionality
   - Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
   - Implement performance optimizations for large file sets

6. Current Work:
   The current focus is on testing the FTP worker implementation using local file mode. The tests confirm the worker can successfully:
   - Detect files with accompanying MD5 hashes
   - Validate the file integrity
   - Upload files to Azure Blob Storage
   - Add messages to the validation queue
   - Move processed files to a "processed" subdirectory
   
   This testing is being done with a special mode that works with local files instead of connecting to an actual FTP server, to simplify the development process.

7. Next Step Recommendation:
   The most logical next step is to conduct comprehensive testing with an actual FTP server using the Docker-based testing environment. This would involve:
   
   1. Fix the Docker Compose script to properly set up the FTP server with test data
   2. Test the FTP connection handling, including the retry mechanism
   3. Verify the handling of various error conditions (file not found, FTP server down, etc.)
   4. Measure and optimize performance with larger datasets
   5. Consider implementing alternative file change detection mechanisms (fsnotify) for better efficiency than polling
   6. Add proper unit tests for the new FTP worker functionality
   7. Document the FTP integration for future developers
