# Hybrid Implementation Plan: Azure Functions & Logic Apps

## Architecture Components

### Azure Functions Components
1. **Data Validation Function**
   - Purpose: Verify data integrity and perform checksum validation
   - Trigger: Blob storage trigger when new data arrives
   - Input: USV survey data files in Azure Blob Storage
   - Output: Validation results with metadata
   - Key Operations:
     - Parse incoming file metadata
     - Extract and validate checksums
     - Perform data format validation
     - Log validation results to tracking database

2. **Data Processing Function**
   - Purpose: Prepare data for transfer (compression, format conversion if needed)
   - Trigger: Queue message after successful validation
   - Input: Validated USV data files
   - Output: Processed files ready for transfer
   - Key Operations:
     - Apply any necessary transformations
     - Generate transfer metadata
     - Update tracking information

3. **AWS Authentication Function**
   - Purpose: Generate secure, vessel-specific credentials for S3 access
   - Trigger: HTTP request from Logic App
   - Input: Vessel ID and operation type
   - Output: Time-limited AWS credentials
   - Key Operations:
     - Retrieve vessel-specific keys from Azure Key Vault
     - Generate temporary credentials with minimal permissions
     - Apply geo-restrictions if supported

### Logic App Workflows

1. **Master Orchestration Workflow**
   - Purpose: Coordinate end-to-end pipeline execution
   - Trigger: Scheduled (configurable interval)
   - Components:
     - Check for new data in Azure Blob Storage
     - Track validation and transfer status
     - Handle error conditions and retries
     - Logging and notification dispatching

2. **S3 Transfer Workflow**
   - Purpose: Handle secure data transfer to AWS S3
   - Trigger: Called from master workflow when data is ready
   - Components:
     - Get vessel-specific credentials (via Function)
     - Upload files to S3 with appropriate prefix
     - Verify transfer success via checksums
     - Update tracking database

3. **Cleanup Workflow**
   - Purpose: Remove validated data after retention period
   - Trigger: Scheduled (daily)
   - Components:
     - Identify files past retention with successful validation
     - Generate deletion certificates
     - Remove data from Azure Blob Storage
     - Log deletion operations

## Integration Points

1. **Shared Database/Storage**
   - Tracking database (Azure SQL/Cosmos DB) for file status
   - Azure Blob Storage for file staging
   - Azure Key Vault for secure credential storage

2. **Function-to-Logic App Integration**
   - HTTP Triggers for Function calls from Logic Apps
   - Queue-based integration for asynchronous operations
   - Shared state in tracking database

3. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Application Insights for unified monitoring
   - Custom dashboards showing end-to-end pipeline status
   - Alerts configured for failures at any stage

## Development Approach

1. **Phase 1: Core Components**
   - Implement Data Validation Function
   - Create Master Orchestration Logic App (simplified)
   - Set up tracking database schema
   - Implement monitoring foundation

2. **Phase 2: Transfer Pipeline**
   - Implement S3 Transfer Logic App
   - Develop AWS Authentication Function
   - Create end-to-end tests with mock data

3. **Phase 3: Cleanup and Compliance**
   - Implement Cleanup Workflow
   - Add audit logging and compliance features
   - Finalize monitoring and alerting

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Testing**
   - Mock inputs/outputs for individual Functions
   - Test Logic App workflows with sample data
   - Validate security implementations

2. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end pipeline testing with simulated data
   - Error injection testing for resilience verification
   - Performance testing with expected data volumes

3. **Mock Ground Station Integration**
   - Mock data generation simulating USV transmission
   - Test various data scenarios (corruption, delays, etc.)

## Deployment Approach

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for all components
   - Parameterized for development, staging, and production
   - Secret management through Key Vault references

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated builds for Functions
   - Automated deployment of Logic App workflows
   - Integration tests as part of deployment validation

3. **Environment Strategy**
   - Development environment with full isolation
   - Staging environment matching production
   - Production environment in Australia region with geo-restrictions
