# USV Data Pipeline Go Implementation Review

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current Go implementation for the USV data pipeline against the requirements specified in `revalare-requirements.md`.

## Requirements Analysis

### 1. Direct upload to per-vessel AWS S3 bucket and prefix
✅ **Implemented**: The code correctly transfers data to S3 with vessel-specific prefixes using the format `vesselID/data/filename`. In `transfer.go` and `s3client.go`, we see the implementation builds the appropriate key structure for organizing the vessel data.

### 2. Dedicated key/secret per vessel with limited permission boundary
⚠️ **Partial Implementation**: The AWS client implementation (`s3client.go`) supports credentials but doesn't show vessel-specific keys. The current implementation uses a global AWS credential set rather than vessel-specific ones. This needs enhancement to use different credentials based on the vessel ID.

### 3. Retention on the vessel until validated in S3
✅ **Implemented**: The implementation maintains data in Azure Blob Storage until successful validation and transfer to S3 is confirmed. The blob metadata is updated with status tracking throughout the pipeline, and deletion only occurs after transfer has been verified.

### 4. Scheduled removals of validated data
✅ **Implemented**: The `cleanup_worker.go` contains logic to remove data after successful transfer to S3. It supports both explicit cleanup via messages and scheduled cleanup based on retention period:
- The retention period is configurable (default 7 days)
- Blobs are only deleted once they're confirmed to be transferred
- The code checks for expired blobs based on the configured retention period

### 5. Audit at project end for data destruction
✅ **Implemented**: The system creates audit records when data is deleted in `audit.go`. These records could be used to generate a destruction certificate. However, the current implementation is file-based for development/testing purposes, and would need to be enhanced for production with persistent storage in Azure Tables.

### Additional Requirements

#### Australia Data Sovereignty
⚠️ **Partial Implementation**: 
- The config enforces AWS region settings (default "ap-southeast-2" for Australia)
- However, there's no specific implementation of geolocking or user access monitoring to prevent foreign nationals from accessing data

#### Worker Pattern Implementation
✅ **Implemented**: The application uses a worker pattern with three types:
- Validation worker: Validates checksums and updates metadata
- Transfer worker: Handles transfer to S3
- Cleanup worker: Manages retention and deletion

#### Error Handling and Retries
✅ **Implemented**: The code includes robust error handling with:
- Configurable retry counts and intervals
- Proper logging throughout the pipeline
- Verification at each step

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Vessel-Specific Credentials**: Implement a credential manager that uses different AWS credentials based on the vessel ID to meet the requirement for dedicated permissions per vessel.

2. **Geo-restriction and Access Controls**: Add implementation for Australia data sovereignty requirements:
   - Azure services geo-restriction
   - User access monitoring and logging
   - IP-based access controls

3. **Enhanced Audit System**: Replace the file-based audit implementation with a production-ready solution that uses Azure Tables or similar persistent storage.

4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Add metrics collection and alerting for better observability of the pipeline.

5. **End-of-Project Procedures**: Implement formal procedures for generating destruction certificates that would satisfy defense requirements.

## Overall Assessment

The Go implementation largely meets the core requirements for transferring USV data to vessel-specific S3 locations with proper validation, retention, and cleanup. The worker pattern provides a solid foundation for scalability and resilience. 

The main areas requiring further enhancement are:
- Vessel-specific credential management
- Formal implementation of Australian data sovereignty requirements
- Production-ready audit and monitoring systems

The application follows good software engineering practices with clean separation of concerns, error handling, and configuration management. With the identified enhancements, it would fully satisfy the Revelare requirements.
