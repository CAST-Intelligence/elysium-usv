# Azure Data Pipeline Development Plan

## Phase 1: Environment & Mock Setup
1. **Mock Data Generator**
   - Create simulated USV survey data with realistic file formats, sizes, and metadata
   - Generate data at various intervals to simulate real-world collection rates
   - Include deliberate data corruption scenarios for testing integrity checks

2. **Azure Environment Setup**
   - Deploy Azure resources in Australia region
     - Storage Account with Blob container (mimicking ground station storage)
     - App Service or Azure Functions for pipeline processing
     - Azure Key Vault for credential management
     - Application Insights for monitoring

3. **Mock S3 Environment**
   - Option A: Set up MinIO server in Azure (S3-compatible open source)
   - Option B: Use Azure Blob with S3-compatible API endpoints
   - Option C: Create separate AWS test account with test S3 buckets

## Phase 2: Core Pipeline Development
1. **Data Validation Service**
   - Develop validation logic for survey data integrity
   - Implement checksum verification
   - Create metadata extraction for tracking

2. **Transfer Services**
   - Build S3 upload components with vessel-specific credentials
   - Implement retry logic and throttling
   - Design storage path conventions matching requirements

3. **Tracking Database**
   - Develop schema for tracking file status (new, validated, transferred, etc.)
   - Implement logging for audit trail

## Phase 3: Testing Framework
1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for full pipeline flow
   - Performance tests with various data volumes

2. **Scenario Testing**
   - Connection interruption scenarios
   - Data corruption handling
   - Recovery from partial transfers

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up dashboards for pipeline health
   - Configure alerts for failure conditions
   - Create reporting for data transfer statistics

## Phase 4: Ground Station Integration
1. **Integration Planning**
   - Document interface specifications for ground station VM
   - Define file naming conventions and metadata requirements
   - Create deployment plan for connecting components

2. **Transitional Architecture**
   - Design switchover approach from mock to real data
   - Create feature flags for gradual component activation
   - Develop parallel run capabilities for verification

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Develop tests that can run against both mock and real systems
   - Create validation suite for end-to-end verification

## Timeline & Resources
- Phase 1: 2 weeks (1 Azure developer, 1 data engineer)
- Phase 2: 3 weeks (2 developers)
- Phase 3: 2 weeks (1 developer, 1 QA engineer)
- Phase 4: Planning now, execution when ground station available

## Next Steps
1. Select Azure service approach (Function Apps vs Logic Apps vs custom services)
2. Choose mock S3 implementation
3. Define data formats and sample files based on expected USV output
4. Set up initial Azure environment with Infrastructure as Code
